      <h1> Galaxies </h1>
      <p> There are four main types of galaxies, spiral, barred spiral, elliptical, and lenticular. Our galaxy, the milky way galaxy, is a spiral galaxy. One of the closest galaxies to us is the Andromeda galaxy. The Andromeda galaxy is 2.537 million light years away. A light year is the distance light travels in one year. There are multiple galaxies but we may never reach them due to the fact that they are to many light years away. <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_galaxies">More galaxies</a> include the Black Eye galaxy, Bode's galaxy, Cartwheel galaxy, Cigar galaxy, annd more! According to scientists there are over 100 billion galaxies.

      <h2> Stars </h2>
      <p> A <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/what-is-a-star/">star</a> is a ball of gas made up of mostly made of hydrogen and helium. Stars are classified by their color, size, and temperature. A star gets its name by classification; a white dwarf, red giant, main sequence, supergiants, protostar and more. When a normal sized star runs out of hydrogen it starts to contract and gains more heat, which makes the upper layer expand and turn into a red giant. After the core begins to cool down the star turns into a white dwarf then into a black dwarf. If the star is huge it will collapse on itself and explode into a supernova, and whatever is left from the star can cause a black hole or form a neutron star. If the color of the star is blue or white it means that the star is hot, while a red or orange star is the coolest star. Besides the sun, the next <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/far-closest-star/">closest star</a> is Alpha Centauri. Alpha Centauri consists of three stars, Centauri A and B, and Proxima Centauri. Alpha Centauri A and B are about 4.37 million light years away from the sun while Proxima Centauri is only 4.27 million light years away making it our next closest star.
