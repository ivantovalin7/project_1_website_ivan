  <h1> Galaxies </h1>
    <p> There are four main types of galaxies, spiral, barred spiral, elliptical, and lenticular. Our galaxy, the milky way galaxy, is a spiral galaxy. One of the closest galaxies to us is the Andromeda galaxy. The Andromeda galaxy is 2.537 million light years away. A light year is the distance light travels in one year. There are multiple galaxies but we may never reach them due to the fact that they are to many light years away. <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_galaxies">More galaxies</a> include the Black Eye galaxy, Bode's galaxy, Cartwheel galaxy, Cigar galaxy, annd more!
